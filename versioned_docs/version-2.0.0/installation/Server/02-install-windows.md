# Installing on Windows
:::warning

Although Windows is often used in business environments, we highly recommend using Caesar on Linux.

:::

First, you have to download the latest version (or the version you want to use) from [GitHub](https://github.com/JWeinelt/Caesar/releases). Save it at any location you want to run later. You have two options on Windows:
- Download the .zip-File like on Linux
- Download the setup.exe file to automatically download and extract all needed files to a directory of your liking.

If you downloaded the zip-File, extract it into the location you want Caesar to be run.

:::note

We always recommend downloading the latest **release** version of Caesar. It contains bug fixes and many improvements.

:::

:::note

If you are using the self-extracting `setup.exe` file, you may need administrative permissions if you want Caesar to be run in e.g. `C:\Program Files\`.

:::

Now, you should have the following files and folders in your selected directory:
```bash
Caesar-Server.jar
start.bat
```

Run ``start.bat`` to start your Caesar Server. It will create all further folders during setup.
